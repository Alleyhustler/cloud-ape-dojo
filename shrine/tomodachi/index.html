    <h2>What is Tomodachi Life?</h2>
    <p>Tomodachi Life is a game created by Nintendo For the 3DS, and it is half Life Sim and half Virtual pet!, as you take care of your Mii's that you have on your device (or even ones from others with QR Codes!) and they all live
      in an apartment together!, they can develop friendships, fall in love, have kids, but they can also fall out or have arguments... So you the player (Or your first characters "Lookalike") act as a god, taking care of your people,
      giving them advice, and gifts!
    </p>
    <h2>Who can you add?</h2>
    <p>If you can somehow make it on the Mii Maker on the 3DS, or find a QR code online, basically anyone you want!, you can add yourself, family or friends, your favorate characters like Hatsune Miku, or even some weird creatons
      like twoface or even, somehow, a burger (i am not kidding LMAO)
    </p>
    <h2>Why does the logo look different to me?</h2>
    <p>Europe and the US both have different logos for some reason, never understood why LOL</p>
    <h2>Is this on Switch?</h2>
    <p><s>I wish it was... Unfortunately Nintendo doesnt seem to care much for Tomodachi Life, but there is, like, a sliver of hope, because of Miitopia (kinda similar, but its more of a babies first RPG.), maybe Nintendo will
      make some sort of sequel or remake, and add some improvements, LET ME HAVE MY YAOI AND YURI NINTENDO.</s>
    </p>
    <p><b>UPDATE AS OF 28/03/2025: Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream was JUST ANNOUNCED FOR NINTENDO SWITCH (and i assume switch 2), so if you wanted to try tomodachi life, either get a 3DS, and or wait for this NEW GAME TO COME OUT (and i think they teased same sex relationships at the end... AND BROUGHT BACK MIITOPIA SWITCHES MAKEUP FEATURES!!!!)</b></p>
    <h2>Why I love this game so much</h2>
    <p>This was pretty much my first game that i "100%", however you do that in a game like this.... but i pretty much did everything in it as a kid, and i just loved seeing all my Mii's become friends and fall in love,
      if anything, it awakend in me that love isnt some weird gross cringe thing, (yes this game may have introduced me to shipping.), and it gave me the feeling of playing with a doll house, which might of been my fem awaking? who knows :pp 
      BUT THE POINT IS, i just love this game because of silly and lovely it can be, it emits what i think to be the last of Nintendo's silly games (that arent Wario Ware).
    </p>

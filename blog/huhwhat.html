  <p>Whenever i have a bad day, or i see a peice of bad news, i like to sorround myself with things i enjoy, wether that be my friends, games that help me relax, or even just coding my website, it helps things become a bit more barable, not that the bad news never leaves my sight of course, its always gonna be there, but i don't let it consume me, sure, i can cry for awhile, or feel really bad, but thats how humans work, we just do that sometimes. I guess what im trying to say is, I love life. I live and breathe life, even with all its flaws, and its horrors, i know its only temporary, weither it goes away on its own, or we fix it ourselves. I will always know that life is always worth living, Talking to my friends and loved ones, doing what i enjoy, it makes me so so god damn happy, i know ill probably go back to bored within like 2 hours, but that doesnt mean i can't enjoy this moment.
  </p>
  <b>(Im all good btw!!!! im just in a really good talkative mood today!)

  <p> Heyooooo!!!! i hope you are all doing well today! apologies for the lack of updates recently, im gonna be fully honest my mind has been a bit dry for ideas for the website, thankfully im still working hard on the pikmin shrine, i just hope people dont think i just abandoned this website, because i very much have NOT, and probably never will!, i love neocities and making websites too much to abandon this stuff!!! even if i have a bit of an idea drought, i hope you all still enjoy what i do put out!
  </p>
  <p>As for the LORE Page for my OC, i might have to completely re-write it entirely, because of certain things i didnt like about it, i mean it came out before i did a complete redesign of my website so its a bit old LMAO, hopefully i can get around to working on it soon!</p>
  <p>If anything, id like to thank Badgraphicsghost and Gremlin (and everyone who likes my neocities updates) for keeping me company while i have my idea drought!!! YOU ARE ALL AMAZING!!! it makes it feel better to know people still look at my site :D</p>
  <p>--------------</p>

  <p>Today the Pope passed away, im not really a religious person, but the fact that he defended LGBTQ rights and people, and called out Israels genocide in Palestine, made me hope that he is happy somewhere in heaven.
  the fact that he died right after all that, after meeting JD Vance and on easter day, is just all poetic. Even if i dont belive in christianity, he was a good person who cared about people. Rest in Peace Francis, I hope your prayers are heard for America, Palestine, and everyone else.
  (Apologies for the sad update, i promise to make a happier one soon.)

  <strong>April 17th.</strong>
  <p>Hello again!!!!! sorry for not updating alot, IM NOW ON BREAK!!!!!!!! so i had to finish some assignments and exams lolll, BUT IM DOING WELL!!!!! ive just been taking my time and resting for a bit, hopefully i can update ALOT more! maybe work on shrines more and make more fake ads because its ALOT of fun!!!, OH AND VERY LATE UPDATE I saw the Minecraft Movie, i really enjoyed it, it was mostly just a really funny movie and nothing else, which is what i expected, i never really think minecraft and "Long Lore", its more like a bunch of people on a server playing and adventuring together, so i think it did well!
  </p>
  <p>Also, i traded in my Xbox Series X (because i never really used it much, and honestly i really hated gamepass so its not much of a loss for me), for credit twords a switch 2, which mostly already paid it off!!!, so i only have to pay around 150$ for it, i am still not planning on buying any of the newer games (because jesus thats 100$ itself), so id rather wait till my game store has a sale on them, for now i might just stick to my current switch collection and the new Mario Kart (which comes with the switch 2), nintendo please for the love of god lower your damn prices ;-; (i just really hope me wanting a switch wont make people dislike me ;-;)
  </p>
  <p>other than all that, I HOPE YOU ARE ALL DOING WELL! you are all amazing and deserving of love, and i love you ALL!!! :DDDDDDDDDDDDD
  </p>

  <strong>April 4th.</strong>
  <p>HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!! apologies for the lack of updates, ive been sick all week :(, some good news tho! NINTENDO SWITCH 2!!!!!!!! AND A BUNCH OF OTHER COOL GAMES LIKE DELTARUNE AND SILKSONG ANNOUNCED, i have been made aware about the prices of the console and the games, right now im trading in stuff that ive never really used or planned to use (my xbox series X) to get the switch 2 for cheaper, but i REFUSE to buy any new switch 2 game thats over 100 AUD for me, my hard limit on games like this is like 60, maybe lower, because its just rediculous, and whats with this "game-key" stuff???? if they are just gonna do that with their games, i might as well just buy them digitally. Im mostly gonna just buy some older switch 1 games i havent played, and maybe buy the switch 2 upgrade for Breath of the Wild (which is only like 10$ for me) because it looks so pretty to me, and only buy switch 2 games when they are on sale for like christmas and stuff! (i feel a bit dumb, because ive been made fun of for wanting to save my money for when swtich 2 games get cheaper during sales :(, also "backup" game people please find a way to do the switch 2 soon....), but anyways, nothing has me more excited than DELTARUNE CHAPTER 3+4!!!!!

  <strong>March 26th</strong>
  <p>Just a small mini blog, ive recently been playing Minecraft again, but in a way that i havent in ages, what do i mean by that? i mean that i litterally HAVE NOT PLAYED singleplayer in YEARS. like the main reason you even buy Minecraft in the first place, usually i play on servers and such, but i usually still feel restricted in those (for good reasons i knowwww), but i finally decided to load up some quality of life mods, add all the music from the main menu to the actual game, and ALOT of animation/sound mods and start actually playing singleplayer, and oh my god. its actually the most relaxed ive felt playing a game. Especially with the sound mods, because i can go the night hearing mobs groan and patrols echo around my wooden house, and i can relax once i hear birds start chirping because it was the morning!!!, sound mods go a LONG FUCKING WAY it turns out LMAO
  </p>
  <p> But seriously ive been enjoying the game as if i was 10 and playing it on my iPad LMAO, ill post progress of my builds here once im able to get a screen shot of it :)
  </p>
  <p>--------------</p>
  
   <strong>March 24th</strong>
  <p>I managed to finish writing my second part of my OC's story, but i'm constantly procrastinating on actually doing the HTML because im so nervous that its not good enough FNDSJFNSDFJSDJF, i might need to rewrite it AGAIN... till i get something that i think is good enough, hopefully one day i wont get cold feet on posting it ;-;
  </p>
  <p>on the bright side, ive been doing some more fun stuff with my website recently, because i need a bit more sillyness here :3, i hope you like the ads on the main page! one of them i just found and the rest are ones i made myself!!!, turns out making fake ads is REALLY fun!!!!, and ive been making my own theme for my 3DS that features my OC!!!! (i might post a download on another blog when its done...)
  </p>
  <p>and finally, I am considering actually going to watch the Minecraft Movie when its out, purely because the entire thing looks like its a satire of itself, and because i fucking LOVE Jack Black, if its good or not good, ill update it here!! :D OK THATS ALL, LOVE YOU ALLLLL!!!!
  </p>
  <p>--------------</p>
   <strong>March 17th</strong>
  <p>HELLO AGAIN!!!! I hope you are doing well whoever is reading this!!!, ive been playing my new Wii a whole bunch recently, and OH MY GOD HOW MUCH IVE MISSED PLAYING GAMES LIKE THIS, call me simple but its just so much more fun to just.... play a game, recent games, while some are still really good, i did miss playing these older games on the Wii... AND ALL THE GAMES I DIDNT GET TO PLAY!!!, Im currently playing through Pikmin 2, and it controls so well! I know this game was originally for the Gamecube but i much prefer the wii version, simply because of the controls AND unlike the Switch release, it still has all the brands plastered onto the game, which i know seems a bit weird to want, but i mean, the first item you get is a damn Duracell battery, cmon BAHAHFNDJFSDFJNDF ;-;
  </p>
  <p>But yea! my Wii adventures are going amazing, in other news, I am currently working on a page before i release my 2nd LOG on my lore stuff (mostly because im too worried people wont like it LMAO), but the page will just be some better instructions for Pretendo on the 3DS (if you follow my neocities you know this already.), becuase simply put, I do not like Pretendos instructions. They are too vauge, and i had to look the rest up on reddit.... so YEA! look out for that soon!! anyways, thats all for today, I LOVE YOU ALL!!!
  </p>
  <p>--------------</p>
  <strong>March 15th</strong>
  <p> THE WII HAS ARRIVED!!!!!! it came with pretty much what i needed, plus an extra controller!!!!!, i immedietly went to go hack it as soon as i got it set up, and i have to say its a little bit more, complicated than a 3DS FNDJFNDSJNFSDJNFJND, BUT IT WAS STILL REALLY EASY TO ME!!!!!, i dont have much to write about, but i will be playing alot more games on the wii for awhile (I NEED TO PLAY RHYTHM HEAVEN!), plus it was the first time i actually sat down and played a game with some people i liked, which was nice!!! (but also alot of yelling... Mario Kart gets heated mannn....), ILL WRITE LOTS MORE WHEN I PLAY IT MORE!!!!!
  </p>
  <p>oh and in other news, THANK YOU ALL FOR 10k VIEWS ON NEOCITIES!!!!! i know that number can be innacurate, but ITS STILL AN AMAZING FEAT FOR ME!!!! i never thought people would like to visit my site, and i wanted to say thank you all so much, you made this web revival thing so welcoming to me... ;-; I LOVE YOU ALL, AND I WANT YOU ALL TO HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY!!!

  <p>So today (or last night?) i may have cried a bit, thankfully they were good tears, because i got an email from someone thanking me for taking them out of an unfortunate situation, I don't wanna say who they were because, well, that would be shitty of me to do, but genuenly it was the most heartfelt THANK YOU i have ever recived in my life, hopefully whoever sent me that email is living well, and i hope they know they made me cry happy tears after so long ;-;

  <strong>March 1st</strong>
  <p>I might just be having a bad day, but things recently have just seemed to suck, as much as i wanna stay positive, its def hitting me hard lmao, maybe its recent news, maybe its friends not feeling well, but i just feel down, it really pains me to see people upset or angry, and i want to give them a big hug so badly, but the most i can do is yell through a digital wall. i think we all need a good hug sometimes. I hope whoever even reads this blog is still having a good day though, sorry for the sad update!
  </p>
  <p>--------------</p>
  <strong>Febuary 25th</strong>
  <p>Thrift shops / Op shops have gotta be the coolest things EVER to me because most of the shit people dont want throw away/donate I always want! like i found atleast 20 movies/shows on DVD for like 15$, and a bunch of old 360 games for the same price, and all the cool knicknacks and trinkets i wanna get so badly, but i know will just clutter up my room LMAO</p>
  <p>but one thing i was so tempted on was getting an old keyboard that had that weird cable on it (PS2 cable i think?) because i wanted to see if it still worked, but i decided to leave it for now, if i ever do pick it up it would be for an old PC setup with XP installed LMAO.</p>
  <p>Oh and because i have so many of these movies and shows, i thought i should back them up onto a hard drive so i don't have to keep swapping DVD's (im not gonna throw them away, NEVER.) its very convinent to have them on my external SSD :3 (also thanks to BadGraph1csGhost for having the datahoarder page that taught me! :D)

    <strong>Febuary 21st</strong>
  <p>so two cool things today, 1. NEW LIKE A DRAGON GAME CAME OUT!!!!!! Im not gonna say much about it here in case someone who reads this likes the series, but i will share <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/fef9nn.mov">this one video that made me absolutely recoil in astonishment.</a>
  </p>
  <p>now for the second cool thing, i recently managed to "fix" my old 3DS XL!!!!! (turns out the batteries connection was loose in the 3DS, just pushed it back into place lol), and not only that, i decided to mod my 3DS (mod? hacking? jailbreaking? idk), so now i have stuff like homebrew and crap!!!!!, im hopefully gonna get some backups of my physical games, and add some GBA stuff to it :3, ITS SO COOL!!!!, loving the custom themes and badges people make too!, its a shame that it isnt one of the New 3DS'es, or the cool 2DS, but i still love this old fuck so much ;-;, maybe i should work on a game log.... ehhh maybe when i get a boost of energy :pp BUT YEAAAA! 2 COOL THINGS!!!!

  <strong>Febuary 18th</strong>
  <p>Random thing popped in my head, i realised how much roblox (game dev wise, not the platform) has improved with the games, i remember playing a really basic ass 4 tower defence game (forgot the name), and when i came back to it, 
  THERES GAMES THAT ARE SOMEHOW MADE USING THE ROBLOX GAME ENGINE, like theres games like <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4972273297/Regretevator-ELEVATOR-SIMULATOR">REGRETEVATOR</a> and <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/12411473842/Pressure">Pressure!!!!</a> (especially Pressure, that game has the most atmospheric horror ive seen in a game, and the music in it is FANTASTIC. Genuienly the Roblox game engine has pushed itself far past from what 
  i remember Roblox games being, and i hope people keep making amazing games, maybe even outside of roblox :3 (Anyways, i hope you had a good day reader!)
  </p>
  <p>--------------</p>
<strong>Febuary 16th 8:49pm</strong>
<p>I decided to try out The Sims 3 again after a long time, because of the recent-ish release of the classic Sims games, and oh my god i MUCH prefered the Sims 3 than Sims 4 LMAO, especially with all the DLC's and expansions. 
  I already started a game with myself obviously, but i do wanna make some other characters, maybe shitposty ones because why not LMAO, I LOVED THIS GAME SO MUCH IDK WHY I HAVENT PLAYED ITTTT. 
  But right as i was gonna save my game, <strong>disaster struck.</strong> My game save suddenly stopped working when i checked it again, kept saying something about an error, i had NO idea what had happened! so i did what anyone else would do.
  I searched up if anyone else had this problem, and it turns out it was all because of one entity that has never served me well ONCE.... <strong>OneDrive. </strong> This parasite on my files had turned out to be AUTOMATICALLY SAVING MY FILES
  TO ONEDRIVE. I usually use Linux more than windows, but i didnt want to go through the headache of getting it to work on there, so i used my windows boot, and i remember why i almost never use windows. As far as the game could tell, the files in the
  "Documents" part of my files, were missing, when in reality, OneDrive stole them all!, thankfully i found out how to fix it by just making another "Sims 3" folder by changing the name of the original, and adding back my save files. 
  OTHER THAN THAT SLIGHT DISASTER DUE TO MICROSOFTS DUMBASSERY. I am loving Sims 3 all over again, and i can't wait to play it more soon :3, Also, wheres what i imagine myself in Sim form! (atleast me in a few years time hopefully LMAO)
</p>
<img style="width: 290px; height: auto;" src="../../files.catbox.moe/ule8cd.png">
<p></p>
<strong>Febuary 15th 9:40pm</strong>
<p>I FINALLY FINISHED THE BLOG!!!! It took me a bit since i wanted it to look nice, but here we are!, here ill just talk about crap that i like
    till either the earth explodes or until i accidentally lose my files somehow LMAO. But now for something completely unrelated, LIKE A DRAGON PIRATE YAKUZA DEMO RELEASED! 
    Ive been playing the demo non stop, and its so god damn fun, the fast as fuck movement, and Majima still being fucking deranged as usual brings me such joy, cannot wait for the 21st when the game comes out, 
    chances are, the moment im free from the story, im just gonna do a full hour of karaoke and play the cooking minigame for about another 14 hours :p, if you told someone the series 
    is a crime drama, they would look at you like you had a fucking gun pointed at you head NFJNDFNDJNFDdn, BUT IM HYPED!, cannot wait to see how RGG cooks for this game. (LOVE YOU MAJIMA)
